# Dijkstra-Visualizer
Personal Project Description:
The following personal project was created to practice the skills I learned in my data structures class, while actively learning how to use and integrate visual elements.

Elements of the Project:
-Run the project as DijsktraVisualizer, not main.cpp
-Creates 10 nodes, with 18 edges (Must be hard-coded to change).
-Line weight is based on distance times the average population density between locations
-Hover over locations to obtain information
-Dropdown menu lets you find the shortest path from staring to end location; must click enter to see change
-SPT button toggles on or off to display the Shortest Path Tree for the starting location
