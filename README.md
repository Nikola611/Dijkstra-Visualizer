# Dijkstra-Visualizer
Personal Project Description:
This personal project was created to practice the skills learned in my data structures class while actively learning how to integrate visual elements. The project provides an interactive visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm, showcasing the shortest path calculations in a graphical format.

Project Features:

Graph Setup: Initializes with 10 nodes and 18 edges (modifiable via hard coding).

Edge Weights: Line weight is determined by the distance multiplied by the average population density between locations.

Interactive Nodes: Hover over nodes to display detailed information.

Pathfinding: Utilize the dropdown menu to find the shortest path from the starting to the end location; click enter to update the visualization.

Shortest Path Tree (SPT): Toggle the SPT button on or off to display the Shortest Path Tree for the starting location.

This project exemplifies proficiency in software design, algorithmic problem-solving, and the practical application of data structure principles. It also demonstrates the ability to integrate complex algorithms with user-friendly visual interfaces.
